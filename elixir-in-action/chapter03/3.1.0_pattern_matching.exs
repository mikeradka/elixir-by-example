PATTERN MATCHING

The '=' operator is not an assignment. Instead, 'a = 1' binds variable 'a' to
the value '1'. The operator '=' is called the 'match operator'. The
assignment-like expression is an example of pattern matching.

Pattern matching is an important construct in Elixir. Pattern matching is a
feature that makes manipulations with complex variables (like tuples and
lists) a lot easier. Pattern matching also allows you to write elegant,
declarative-like conditionals loops.

But first, we will look at the basic mechanical workings of pattern matching
by understanding the match operator.
