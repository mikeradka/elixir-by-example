CONTROL FLOW

This chapter covers:
  - Pattern matching
  - Working with multiclause functions
  - Using conditional expressions
  - Working with loops

Conditionals and Loops in Elixir work differently than in most modern languages.

Classical conditional constructs such as 'if' and 'case' are often replaced
with multiclause functions. There are also no classical loop statements such
as 'while'. But, the resulting code is no more complicated.

The underlying supporting mechanism for branching and looping is pattern
matching, which is discussed first.
