HIGHER-LEVEL TYPES

Because Elixir code runs on BEAM, its type system is heavily
influenced by Erlang's foundations. But on top of the basic
foundational Erlang types, Elixir provides some higher-level
abstractions.

The ones most frequently used are:
  - Range
  - Keyword
  - MapSet
  - Date
  - Time
  - NaiveDateTime
  - DateTime
